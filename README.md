# Todo-List-Website

This is a simple task manager website. It is coded in React with Bootstrap CSS and allows me to make multiple to do lists for different things, write notes, and tells me the weather/recommends clothing based on live weather data from OpenWeatherAPI. It uses Express to make a lightweight server that hosts the backend which handles all the get and post requests from the front end. It also makes use of the Mongoose package to connect to my MongoDB database. I make heavy use of mongoose to create new documents/collections in my database, update documents, and delete documents. Finally, I used MongoAtlas to make my own cluster in the cloud and transferred my database from my local device to the cloud. Now, all my todo lists and notes are always saved and ready for me when I open my website on my laptop again.
